# studying_Java

## Purpose of this repository

I'm on a journey: learn Java!

In this repository there are some basic exercises that show an initial learning process of the Java programming language
and OOP paradigm.

Made for the college subject of Objects Oriented Programming.

## The problems

- Circle.java

-> Class that creates a circle with a center (made using Dot.java class), a radius and a name. It calculates it's area, diameter
and circunference. The user can change the name of the circle as well. The last method was created to show the outputs of the code.

- Triangle.java

-> Class that creates a triangle with sides that cannot be zero nor negatives numbers, and if they are zero or negative, the code
will store the 1 as its value. Besides, the code will analyse if the triangle can exists (a triangle exists if one of its sides is
lower than the sum of the other two sides). There is a method that calculates the perimeter of the triangle and another one that
tell the user if the triangle created is scalene, isoceles or equilateral.

- Dot.java

-> Class that calculates the distance between two dots.

## Running the codes

I didn't build -- yet -- a little system where the user can run and interact with the code using the terminal. 
Instead I just used App.java class to create new instances of the classes listed above and passed values to the variables.

So, to run the codes, you can change the values on the classes' instances.

-- but I'll change this in the future --
