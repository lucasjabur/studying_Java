# studying_Java

## Purpose of this repository

I'm on a journey: learn Java!

In this repository there are some basic exercises that show an initial learning process of the Java programming language
and OOP paradigm.

Made for the college subject of Objects Oriented Programming.

## The structre

Each folder is a list of exercises.

Inside each folder there will be a README.md that contains the info about the exercises and what I've learned.

The way that each exercise was built perhaps is NOT the best possible. I'm just programming the way I've learned, but
most importantly is the evolution over the time.

## Running the codes

I didn't build -- yet -- a little system where the user can run and interact with the code using the terminal. 
Instead I just used App.java class to create new instances of the classes listed above and passed values to the variables.

So, to run the codes, you can change the values on the classes' instances.

-- but I'll change this in the future if convenient --

## Remember

The codes are simple and perhaps not written in the best possible way due to my limited knowledge so far.

It's important to say that I don't intend to improve the codes once they've been posted, as I'd like to make the defects of
the first codes explicit so that it's possible to make a better comparison with the latest codes in order to show my evolution
throughout the course and over time.
