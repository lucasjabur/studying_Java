# The classes:

## FstExercise.java

- Class with hour, minutes and seconds as it's attributes with implementation of constructors to create differente instances.
It validates the information given to the class.

## SndExercise.java

- The same class as Dot.java from the "firstList" exercises, but with the implementation of constructors, the first one
initiates the class with the coordinates of the first dot, and the second one initiates them with zero as its values.

## ThdExercise.java

- Class given by the professor for us to implement two types of constructors: the first one initiate the class with all the
attributes and the second one initiate the class with the balance equals to zero.

## FrthExercise.java

- The same class as Triangle.java from the "firsList" exercises, but with the implementation of a constructor that initiates
the triangle's sides.

# The goal:

The goal here is to learn how to use the Java constructors, what they are used for and their importance.
Still learning and improving!
